When we think a product is finished and here to stay, we put it out to you, to the public. In the beginning of January 2016 it was that prime time. The temporary BYBORRE pop-up was a gallery and store where the team of BYBORRE was present everyday to show and talk about the new collection, development and our love for textile.

In the pop-up people could try the unisex collection named the General and set a pre-order. We made a matching scarf showcasing the look and feel of our first wardrobe pieces. All will be for sale in our webshop starting late August.

The BYBORRE pop-up was located at the Hobbemastraat 9, Amsterdam
