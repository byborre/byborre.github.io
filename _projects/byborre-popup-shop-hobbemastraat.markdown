When we think a product is finished and here to stay, we put it out to you, to the public. Now is the prime time. The BYBORRE pop-up is a gallery and store where the team of BYBORRE is present everyday to show and talk about the new collection, development and our love for textile.

In the pop-up you can try the unisex collection named the General and set a pre-order. We made a matching scarf showcasing the look and feel of our first wardrobe pieces.

If you are not able to drop by, the scarfs are already for sale in our newly opened [webshop](/shop). The garments will follow soon online.
