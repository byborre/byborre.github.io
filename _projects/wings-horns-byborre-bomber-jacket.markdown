ByBorre is the namesake design studio of Amsterdam-based textile developer Borre Akkersdijk, whose innovative approach to fabric design incorporates techniques traditional to Scandinavia’s mattress and upholstery industry.

For Fall/Winter 2015, wings+horns partnered with byBorre to develop a custom multi-dimensional fabric for two limited edition bomber jackets. The fabric, made at Akkersdijk’s Dutch lab on a circular knitting machine, is an interpretation of the signature wings+horns ‘Tiger Spruce’ camouflage pattern.

The wings+horns x byBorre bomber is designed and made in Canada. Details include articulated stretch-nylon sleeves insulated with Polartec Alpha, signature pebbled snaps, and a co-branded leather interior patch.
