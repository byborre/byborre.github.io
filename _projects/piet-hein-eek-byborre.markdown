The tendency of Piet Hein Eek to avoid throwing away materials and rather use them as a basis for designs, thus making them of inestimable value, is shared by BYBORRE. In this collaboration old silk fabrics for menâ€™s ties form the base material. Piet Hein Eek took over a large quantity of silk fabric from the warehouse of Spazio Rossana Orlandi, a former Milanese tie factory.

When BYBORRE took a look at the fabric, he was inspired by his journey to China, where he had also been forced by circumstances to make use of unconventional materials, to create his own material to work on. Combining already available materials with production methods and products to come up with a new product in a new context provides the opportunity to create a new material in a simplified manner. BYBORRE has batting placed between two rolls of silk and then has it quilted. In the first tests, it was easy to make a comparison with the padded fabrics of BYBORRE. The tie silks are carefully chosen for colour, pattern and quilt pattern. Without wasting any silk, the fabric combinations are stitched together, with binding all around the edges, and a leather label is affixed noting the collaboration.
