For the fashion biennale in the Netherlands BYBORRE was asked by Lidewij Edelkoort to create an atelier.

The theme fetishism lead to the development of the MoBa Scarf inspired by the human vein structure.

The BYBORRE scarfs originate from the development of the 3D knitted textiles. While developing our first Paris fashion week show we found the rest material to be a one of a kind scarf.
From that point on we perfected the production process of these scarfs until there was no waste material at all. Design efficiency!

### Yarn sourcing

At BYBORRE we hand select the best yarns to get the best quality.

* Front + Back - double treaded Bio-cotton from Italy
* Filling yarn - special BB filling Polyester that will get more volume the more it is used

### Product development / Circular Knitting

This product is directly developed on the circular knitting machine with BYBORRE signature knitting technique. At BYBORRE we program and handle the machines ourselves.


### Product finishing

After running the circular knitting files the textiles will checked one by one at our quality control and steamed by hand. We finish the scarfs in-house in Amsterdam. And we guarantee the more you use it the softer and nicer the product will become.
